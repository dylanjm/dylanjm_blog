      <description>Iâ€™m currently working on building a quantitative macroeconomics course with a professor of mine. The goal of the course is to introduce students within the Economics department to programming in Python and R. This is a big step for our department. Even though we have always been a fairly math heavy econ degree, the department has been stuck behind the curve in teaching students new and to date technicial skills. This professor, along with my help, wants to move the courses away from teachin STATA and Excel to equiping students with proper data analysis tools for the workforce and academia.</description>
