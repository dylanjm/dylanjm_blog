__"I'm always trying to do the stupidest possible thing to allow me to get out of the project alive. Unfortunatley, the stupidest possible thing that could possibly work always seems to be a little bit more complicated than most complicated thing I already know how to do."__

Hello, my name is Dylan James McDowell. I am Financial Economics undergraduate with hopes to pursue a graduate degree in Mathematical Statistics with a research focus in Bayesian Methods & Decision Theory. I love coding in [#rstats](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash) and [#python](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Python?src=hash) and currently am learning Stan. I love to read, write, and have #woahdude deep discussions with friends. I named this blog "Uninformed Priors" because __1)__ I'm really interested in Bayesian Statistics and __2)__ It desribes the way I often approach life with an open mind. Currently, I work as a Junior Data Scientist for a non-profit consulting firm primarily on agronomy projects.
