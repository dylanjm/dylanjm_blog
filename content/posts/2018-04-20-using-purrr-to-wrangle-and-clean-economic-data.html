<p>I‚Äôm currently working on building a quantitative macroeconomics course with a professor of mine. The goal of the course is to introduce students within the Economics department to programming in Python and R. This is a big step for our department. Even though we have always been a fairly math heavy econ degree, the department has been stuck behind the curve in teaching students new and to date technicial skills. This professor, along with my help, wants to move the courses away from teachin STATA and Excel to equiping students with proper data analysis tools for the workforce and academia.</p>
<p>The course is focusing on the material found in <a href="http://books.wwnorton.com/books/webad.aspx?id=4294993402">Macroeconomics 4th Edition by Charles I. Jones</a> which, itself, is not focused on programming at all. We want to build a programming curriculum around the concepts in the book so students can stay interested in application of these skills.</p>
<p>One of the first assignments asks the students to read in data regarding per capita GDP of several countries around the world and greate a graphic showing the change in per capita GDP over time. The author in the book directs students to the data found at: <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~chadj/snapshots.pdf">Country Snapshots 9.0</a>, which is a wonderful PDF document containing example plots and links to the excel files storing these economic data.</p>
<p>My professor is worried about changes to the datasets in the future and has asked me to create a repository of pre-cleaned datasets that the students can access without worrying about the data disapearing into the future. Since the class is only focused on the basics of programming, I figured I would clean up the data and store it in a nice table for students to access later.</p>
<p>In this write up we‚Äôll use <code>library(purrr)</code> to automate this retrevial of data. Some of the funcitons that we‚Äôll use from purrr are <code>compact()</code>, <code>map_df()</code>, and <code>possibly()</code> to ensure that our code is as dynamic as possible. So let‚Äôs begin!</p>
<p><strong>Here are some libraries we‚Äôll need to finish this task:</strong></p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse) # Includes purrr &amp; %&gt;% operator
library(rio) # Will make reading in our .xls files quick and simple
library(rvest) # We&#39;ll utilize web scraping for a brief moment to get a list of country codes
library(janitor) # Awesome package that makes cleaning messy data really easy</code></pre>
<p>The students will be asked to create a plot from the data of any country of there choosing from <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~chadj/countrycodes6.3">this list of country codes</a>. This means that we‚Äôll need every possible country dataset pulled down and cleaned for students to utilize. Since we want to make sure we have the most recent list of countries everytime we run this code we‚Äôre going to use <code>library(rvest)</code> to scrape this list and clean up it so we can use the sweet TLA (Three-Letter-Abreviation) country codes hidden inside üòãüòãüòã.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Rcode to go and fetch country codes
# Note: Wrapping the expression in parentheses &quot;()&quot; just evaluates and prints
# the results on the spot.

<p>Perfect! If you step back through the code and run it line by line you‚Äôll see why we needed to use a regular expression to pull all the TLA‚Äôs from the web scraping results. The final pipe statements just orders the TLA‚Äôs in alphbetical order. Now we can use these codes to loop through the urls that hold all the excel files (i.e. <code>http://www.stanford.edu/~chadj/snapshots/TLA.xls</code>). But before we do that, let‚Äôs write a function to handle all the data munging and cleaning we‚Äôll need.</p>
<p><strong>Taking a look at the USA excel file shows some cleaning needs to be done</strong></p>
<p><img src="../../img/usa_dat.png" /></p>
<p>Right off the bat we can see we‚Äôll need to skip the first few lines of code. There also appears to be a row of blank values after each of the headers. We‚Äôll want to make sure we get rid of unneccesary missing data and ensure that each column is correctly typed as numeric. Since our goal is to use purrr to eventually loop through all possible countries, we‚Äôll also want to create a column of the what country these data belong to. This will help when it comes to plot and store these data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>read_and_clean &lt;- function(country_code = &quot;USA&quot;){
  dat_url &lt;- paste0(&quot;http://www.stanford.edu/~chadj/snapshots/&quot;, country_code, &quot;.xls&quot;)
  import(dat_url, skip = 9) %&gt;% 
    clean_names() %&gt;% # Great function from library(janitor)
    na.omit() %&gt;% 
    filter(population != &quot;NaN&quot;) %&gt;% 
    mutate_all(as.numeric) %&gt;% 
    mutate(country = country_code)
}</code></pre>
<p><strong>A quick run of this function with ‚ÄúUSA‚Äù as the default country code shows nice and tidy output:</strong></p>

<p>Now given that I have ran and figured out all this code, for this next part I‚Äôm going to do a little hand waving. Apparently, there are some countries in our <code>country_codes</code> list that don‚Äôt keep track of this data. Therefore, in my initial attempts to use <code>map()</code> to iterate across all TLA‚Äôs, it would error out when running across a country that didn‚Äôt have a corresponding excel file. This is why we need to use the <code>possibly()</code> function. For more info run <code>?purrr::possibly()</code> in your R console.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Now we may &quot;possibly&quot; be able to run this code without it stopping lol
possibly_read_and_clean &lt;- possibly(read_and_clean, otherwise = NULL)</code></pre>
<p><strong>At this point we have three things left to do:</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Iterate through all country TLA‚Äôs to create a list of data.frames.</p></li>
<li><p>Given the missing files for some countries, drop the inevitible NA‚Äôs from our list using <code>purrr:compact()</code></p></li>
<li><p>Use <code>purrr::map_df()</code> and <code>bind_rows()</code> to create one large data.frame for storing.</p></li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code>final_clean_dat &lt;- purrr::map(country_codes, ~ possibly_read_and_clean(.x)) %&gt;% 
  compact() %&gt;% 
  map_df(bind_rows)</code></pre>
<p>Yay! üòÑ Now we have one large dataset that can be updated at anypoint in time but also will remain unchanged in case the datasets ever go offline. This code will allow the students to focus more on the applications at hand and save the data cleaning for a later class. Since we‚Äôve made it this far, let‚Äôs finish off with a plot!</p>
<pre class="r"><code>final_clean_dat %&gt;% 
  filter(country %in% c(&quot;USA&quot;,&quot;RUS&quot;,&quot;CHN&quot;,&quot;JPN&quot;)) %&gt;%

<p>That‚Äôs it, thanks for reading. Hopefully you can gained a little better understanding of the usefullness of purrr and the functions it contains. You can find a gist of the script at my <a href="https://gist.github.com/dylanjm/474ab30a18a96e19c139d19801f0acc2">github account</a>. ‚àé</p>
